# graphscad

 Graphscad is a free nodal editor to create customizable 3D objects for 3D printers

Graphscad provide advanced features :

        Several advanced nodes like Gears and Pulley, Box, LookAt etc....
        No more headache with rotations and translations order : transfom nodes can work in 'World' space like usual, but it's possible to create transfoms in 'Local' space and 'Object' Space.
        Graphscad is Modular : a graphscad file with parameters is a module that can be used from an other graphscad file with 'callmodule' nodes.
        Graphscad graph datas are embedded in created .scad files (in comment section). So a .scad file created with graphscad can be be directly used by Openscad, and shared
        Source code of all nodes is provided, you can create and share your own nodes with basic python knowledge.
